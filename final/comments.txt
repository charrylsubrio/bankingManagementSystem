1. bank8.c - initial deposit at creating account doesn't recorded in the history of transaction.
	i. When the code in the deposit function copied to the initial balance, loggedClient & deposit variables are undeclared.
	ii. Possible solution: make it global variables.
	iii. loggedClient is function pointer parameter for the logged in client.
	iv. Substitute variables
	v. It is now recorded but with zero amount, it should be the initial deposit.
	vi. Possible solution: instead of deposit, make it initial balance.
	vii. Fixed and version update to bank9.c
